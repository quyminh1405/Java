- A common type of input that needs to be read into a program is file inputs. In this example, I have a text file called
'Example', which contains several lines of text. I want to be able to print out the file, line by line, in my program.
One of the ways to do this is with a buffered reader. Buffered readers allow you to read lines of characters, and will
work with multiple input encodings. So you can use them to read files in languages from all over the world. So, in my
main method, the first thing I need to do is gut the file. So I will create a new file variable, and call it my file,
and I will assign it to a new file variable. Parsing in the name of the file, which is 'Example.txt'.
